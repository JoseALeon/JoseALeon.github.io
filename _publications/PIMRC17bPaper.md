**Abstract:** In this paper, an optimized cooperative communication scheme based on the recently presented LTE-V2X is introduced. LTE-V2X is the newly proposed technology by 3GPP in its Release 14 in order to obtain a feasible communication scheme between vehicles and infrastructures. This paper investigates the case of centralized network architecture, where the eNodeBs are used as information centers in order to optimize the scheduling scheme by means of clustering the vehicles in their coverage range. The proposed cooperative scheme is based on the shared messages between vehicles using a semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) which fulfills the rigid requirements, i.e., delay and reliability, faced in vehicular communications. In this paper, an enhancement of the SPS is defined using the information gathered by the network infrastructures in order to mitigate the interference. In addition, due to the high mobility of the vehicles, a predictive control model is implemented to estimate the vehicles trajectory, hence, improving the scheduling scheme performance. The aforementioned methods are simulated in a realistic scenario, using a traffic simulator, and compared with the standard LTE-V2X implementation as well as other methods proposed in the literature.
