**Abstract:** Sensor based automated driving technologies, e.g., Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), have been developed for many years in order to increase the traffic efficiency. Moreover, in the last decade, there has been a growing interest in further optimizing the traffic efficiency with the help from Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications, e.g., Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC). This paper investigates the utilization of V2V communication in platooning systems which is one fundamental application in future Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). A novel V2V assisted platooning system is proposed in this paper, where a proposed prediction based control scheme is used to reduce the required intra-platoon gap under the stability constraint. Moreover, the impact of V2V communications range, delay and reliability on the performance of such platooning systems is discussed. Based on the distributed scheduling scheme in 3GPP Rel. 14 LTE-V2X sidelink (SL), a platoon based scheduling scheme is proposed to increase the intra-platoon V2V communication reliability.
