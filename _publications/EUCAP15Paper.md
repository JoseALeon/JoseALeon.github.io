<b>Abstract:</b> The wireless channel in mobile communications changes the transmitted signal and thus must be properly modeled. If a multiple-input multiple- output (MIMO) system is considered, the modeling procedure becomes more challenging.
In this paper, a novel radio channel model is implemented and validated using measurement data. On one hand, statistical properties of MIMO channels are modeled by geometry-based stochastic models, such as the WINNER II model. On the other hand, the physical phenomena of radio wave propagation can be described by deterministic methods, such as PIROPA (parallel implemented ray optical propagation algorithm). Additionally, the proposed channel model can be derived by combining the stochastic model and physical model. The results show that the proposed channel model has advantages in modeling accuracy and execution time over the WINNER II model.
