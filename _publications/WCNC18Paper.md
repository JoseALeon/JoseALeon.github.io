**Abstract:** In this work we address the joint design of the wireless backhauling network topology, as well as the frequency/power allocation on the wireless links, where the nodes are capable of full-duplex (FD) operation. The proposed joint design enables the coexistence of multiple access/backhaul links at the same channel, resulting in an enhanced spectral efficiency.
Moreover, it enables the usage of FD capability when/where it is gainful. In this regard, a mixed-integer-linear-program (MILP) design framework is proposed, aiming at a minimum cost design for the wireless backhaul network, considering the required rate demand at each base station, as well as the various operational limits. The numerical simulations show a reduction in the network cost via the utilization of the proposed designs, thanks to the coexistence of multiple links on the same channel due to the FD capability.
